# 🔋 Frank Energie - Smart Battery Manager

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpwnypower%2FSmartcharging-HA%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fautomation%2Fblueprints%2FSmartcharging%20frankenergie.yaml)


**The ultimate "Set & Forget" automation for home batteries with dynamic energy tariffs.**

This blueprint turns your Home Assistant into an intelligent energy manager. It calculates the optimal charging schedule based on **day-ahead prices** (Frank Energie, Tibber, Zonneplan), **solar forecasts**, and your **battery usage**.

It solves the "Empty Battery Anxiety" by guaranteeing a charged battery in the morning, while still optimizing for the lowest possible costs during the rest of the day.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Intelligent Scheduling:** Analyzes prices for today *and* tomorrow to find the absolute cheapest hours.
* **☕ Morning Guarantee:** Ensures you wake up with a charged battery (e.g., 50%) for the morning peak, prioritizing cheap night hours, even if the afternoon is cheaper.
* **☀️ Solar Forecasting:** Automatically adjusts charge targets based on the weather. Expecting sun? It leaves space in the battery. Dark winter day? It charges fully from the grid.
* **💰 Smart Holding (Trading Logic):** Prevents the battery from discharging (or charging) when it's not profitable. It remembers your buy price and only allows usage if the current price exceeds the `Buy Price + Profit Margin`.
* **🛡️ Hardware Protection:** Includes "Anti-Cycling" logic. Once charging starts, it stays active for at least 30 minutes to protect your inverter's EEPROM/Flash memory from excessive switching.
* **📊 Daily Reporting:** Sends a detailed plan to your phone every morning and evening (Status, Financial thresholds, Scheduled hours).
* **🌍 Multi-Language:** Fully localized in **English** and **Dutch** (Nederlands).

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before importing this blueprint, ensure you have the following in Home Assistant:

### 1. Integrations
* **Dynamic Price Sensor:** An integration that provides current and future electricity prices (e.g., Frank Energie, Tibber, ENTSO-e). The sensor must have a `prices` (or similar) attribute containing future data.
* **Solar Forecast:** The standard [Forecast.Solar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/forecast_solar/) integration (configured for your location).

### 2. Helpers (Required!)
You must create **one** helper manually for the "Smart Holding" logic to work.
Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers > Create Helper**:

1.  **Input Number** (Required):
    * **Name:** `Last Purchase Price` (or *Laatste Laadprijs*)
    * **Icon:** `mdi:currency-eur`
    * **Min:** `0`, **Max:** `5`
    * **Step:** `0.001`
    * *Purpose: The automation saves the electricity price here when it starts charging, so it knows when it's profitable to hold or discharge later.*

2.  **Input Boolean** (Optional):
    * **Name:** `Battery Boost`
    * *Purpose: A manual switch to force-charge the battery to 100% immediately, ignoring all logic.*

## 🚀 Installation & Configuration

1.  Click the **Import to Home Assistant** badge above (or copy the URL of the yaml file).
2.  Create a new automation using the blueprint.
3.  Map your entities (Battery SoC, Switches, Price Sensor).

### 🔧 Key Settings Explained

#### 🛡️ Morning Guarantee (%)
* **What is it?** The minimum percentage you need to survive the morning peak (07:00 - 12:00).
* **How it works:** If it's night and your battery is below this level, the system **will** charge during the cheapest night hours, even if the price is effectively "high" compared to the afternoon.
* **Recommended:** `40%` - `60%`.

#### 📈 Min. Profit Margin (%)
* **What is it?** The financial buffer.
* **How it works:** The system calculates the strict hours needed to reach your target. Any *extra* "buffer" hours are only charged if the price is `X%` lower than the daily average.
* **Recommended:**
    * `5% - 10%`: Focus on comfort (Full battery is priority).
    * `20%+`: Focus on ROI (Only charge when it's a steal).

#### ☀️ Summer Threshold (kWh)
* **What is it?** The boundary between a "Sunny Day" and a "Dark Day".
* *How it works:*
    * Forecast > Threshold: Uses **Target Summer** (e.g., 30%). Leaves room for free solar energy.
    * Forecast < Threshold: Uses **Target Winter** (e.g., 90%). Fills up from the grid.

## 🧠 Logic Flow (How it thinks)

Every 5 minutes (and on price changes), the automation performs this check:

1.  **Safety Check:** Are we in a valid time slot (Night/Day)?
2.  **Morning Check:** Is it night, and is SoC < `Morning Guarantee`?
    * *Yes:* Find cheapest hours in the **Night Slot** to bridge the gap. -> **Charge.**
3.  **Target Check:** Is SoC < `Daily Target` (Winter/Summer)?
    * *Yes:* Calculate total hours needed. Find cheapest hours in **All Slots** (Night + Day).
    * *Strict Check:* Is current price one of the absolute cheapest? -> **Charge.**
    * *Buffer Check:* Is current price profitable (`< Daily Average - Margin`)? -> **Charge.**
4.  **Holding Check:** If we are NOT charging:
    * Is current price < (`Last Buy Price` + `Margin`)? -> **Block Discharge** (Hold energy).
    * Is current price High? -> **Allow Discharge** (Save money).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: I see "No charging planned" in the report, but the price is low.**
A: The price might be low, but the system sees even *lower* prices coming up later in your allowed time slots. It waits for the bottom.

**Q: Why does it keep charging for 30 minutes even if the price went up?**
A: This is the **EEPROM Protection**. To prevent your inverter hardware from wearing out due to constant switching, the charger enforces a minimum runtime of 30 minutes (unless the battery reaches 100%).

**Q: The report says "Morning" and "Strict". What's the difference?**
A: `Morning` means charging is forced to ensure you survive the morning. `Strict` means charging is purely based on the absolute lowest prices of the next 24-36 hours.
